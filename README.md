# Artist Sentiment Analysis

This project allows you to successfully enter an artist into genius.com's API, pull out some of their songs, then get those lyrics for those songs, then run a sentiment analysis on each of the songs, returning the song's sentiment analysis along with the name of the song. Scores vary between -1 for negative and 1 for positive. At this current time, all inputs must be declared a string, by surrounding them with ''.

Right now, this is just a technical coding sample, no user interface has been built. This is coming soon!
